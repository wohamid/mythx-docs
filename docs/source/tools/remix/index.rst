Remix integration with MythX
============================

MythX is available as a plugin for `Remix <https://remix.ethereum.org>`_, a popular web-based IDE for smart contract development and deployment, created and hosted by the Ethereum Foundation.

Setup
-----

.. note:: These instructions will show the Remix interface that is current as of early-2020. We recommend everyone use this interface.

Because Remix is a web-based interface, no local installation is required. However, MythX will need to be specifically activated from within the Remix Plugin Manager before use.

To activate MythX in Remix:

#. Click the :guilabel:`Plugins` icon (which resembles a plug).

   Alternately, click the :guilabel:`See all Plugins` button under :guilabel:`Featured Plugins`.

#. The full list of plugins for Remix will be displayed. Scroll down to the entry titled :guilabel:`MythX Security Verification` and click :guilabel:`Activate`.

   .. note::  You need to link your Ethereuem account to your MythX account (can be setup via https://mythx.io) to use MythX with Remix. 

Usage
-----

You can perform a security analysis on any contract in any open file on Remix.

To perform an analysis:

#. Click the MythX logo on the sidebar to open the MythX control panel (if it isn't already open).

#. Below the credentials section, there will be a select box containing a list of all applicable contracts. Select the contract you wish to analyze and click the :guilabel:`Analyze` button. You can also select the scan mode as shown below:

Refer to the `plans <https://mythx.io/plans/>`_ page to see which plan you need for each mode. 

   .. note:: The contract may need to be compiled first, depending on the current Remix settings. Make sure the :guilabel:`Solidity Compiler` plugin for Remix is activated in your project. You will have to click the Solidity icon and then click the :guilabel:`Compile` button for your contract.

#. Depending on the scan mode selected, the analysis may take a few minutes. When completed, a list of vulnerabilities will be displayed, along with a link to the `SWC Registry <https://smartcontractsecurity.github.io/SWC-registry/>`_ for each vulnerability found.
